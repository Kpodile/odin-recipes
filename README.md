# odin-recipes

This is my first odin project, to my knowledge this project will be of creating a website for recipes using only html.

I'm about to test my HTML skills "GOODLUCK!!"

I'm done with the project. after testiing the website on both desktop and mobile, i want to fix something with it
and that is to make images responsive on mobile.
